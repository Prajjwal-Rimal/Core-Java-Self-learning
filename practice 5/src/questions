Here are some additional Java practice questions focusing on **constructors**, including **default and parameterized constructors**, and **naming conventions**:

### **13. Constructors**
- **Default Constructor**:
  - Write a Java program to create a `Car` class with attributes like `model` and `year`. Use a default constructor to initialize these attributes with some default values. Print the details of the car using a method.

  - Write a program that has a `Product` class with a parameterized constructor that accepts parameters like `productName`, `productId`, and `price`. Create an array of `Product` objects and display their details.

- **Constructor Overloading**:
  - Write a Java program to demonstrate constructor overloading by creating a `Person` class with three constructors: one with no parameters, one with one parameter (`name`), and one with two parameters (`name` and `age`). Create objects using different constructors and display their values.
  - Create a `Triangle` class that has constructors to initialize:
    - Only the base of the triangle.
    - Both the base and height of the triangle.
    - Write methods to calculate the area using different constructors.
  - Implement a `BankAccount` class that has overloaded constructors:
    - A default constructor with no parameters.
    - A constructor that initializes `accountNumber` and `accountHolderName`.
    - A constructor that initializes `accountNumber`, `accountHolderName`, and `initialBalance`.

### **14. Naming Conventions**
- **Classes and Interfaces**:
  - Create a Java class that demonstrates proper naming conventions for classes, interfaces, and methods. Follow Java conventions by using PascalCase for classes (`StudentDetails`, `BankAccount`) and interfaces (`Readable`, `Printable`), and camelCase for methods (`calculateTotalMarks`, `displayDetails`).

- **Variables and Methods**:
  - Write a program to demonstrate proper naming conventions for variables and methods. Use camelCase for variable names (`studentName`, `totalMarks`) and method names (`calculateAverageMarks`, `displayStudentInfo`).

- **Constants**:
  - Implement a program where you define constants using `final` keyword with proper naming conventions (all uppercase letters with underscores). For example, `final int MAX_STUDENTS = 100;` and `final double PI = 3.14159;`.

### **Practice Questions on Naming Conventions and Constructors**
1. **Write a program to demonstrate proper naming conventions** by creating a `Library` class with attributes `libraryName`, `libraryLocation`, and methods like `addBook()`, `removeBook()`, and `listBooks()`.
2. **Create a class `Employee`** with private attributes `name`, `id`, and `salary`. Use a parameterized constructor to initialize these values. Write getters and setters following Java naming conventions and display the employee details.
3. **Implement a `Vehicle` class** with a default constructor that initializes default values, and a parameterized constructor that initializes make, model, and year. Demonstrate the use of both constructors by creating objects.
4. **Write a program using constructor overloading** in a `Customer` class to initialize:
    - Only customer name.
    - Customer name and ID.
    - Customer name, ID, and address. Use proper naming conventions for all variables, methods, and constructors.
5. **Create a `Person` class** that demonstrates proper naming conventions and uses both default and parameterized constructors to initialize attributes like `firstName`, `lastName`, and `age`. Write methods to display the details of a person.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### **15. Anonymous Objects**
1. **Create an anonymous object** of a `Calculator` class and use it to perform addition of two numbers. Write a method `add(int a, int b)` in the `Calculator` class and call it using an anonymous object.
2. **Write a Java program** that uses an anonymous object to call a method that prints the area of a circle with a given radius.
3. **Implement a program** that defines a class `Greeting` with a method `sayHello()` that prints a greeting message. Use an anonymous object to call this method.

### **16. Need for Inheritance in Java**
1. **Explain with an example** why inheritance is needed in Java. Write a program that demonstrates code reusability by creating a base class `Animal` with common properties and derived classes like `Dog` and `Cat`.
2. **Write a Java program** that shows how inheritance helps in method overriding. Create a base class `Vehicle` with a method `run()`. Create a derived class `Car` that overrides the `run()` method. Explain why method overriding is useful.
3. **Discuss the need for inheritance** by creating an example where you have a `Shape` class with a method `draw()`. Create subclasses like `Circle` and `Rectangle` that inherit from `Shape` and override the `draw()` method to provide specific implementations.

### **17. Inheritance in Java**
1. **Create a base class `Person`** with attributes like `name` and `age`. Derive a subclass `Student` that adds an attribute `studentId` and a method `study()`. Write a program to demonstrate the concept of inheritance.
2. **Write a program** that demonstrates inheritance by creating a base class `Employee` with methods like `work()`. Derive two subclasses, `Manager` and `Developer`, each with its own unique method (`manageTeam()` and `writeCode()` respectively).
3. **Implement a class hierarchy** where a base class `Appliance` has a method `turnOn()`. Derive classes like `WashingMachine` and `Refrigerator` that inherit from `Appliance` and add specific methods such as `startWashCycle()` and `setTemperature()`.

### **18. Single and Multilevel Inheritance**
1. **Single Inheritance**:
   - Write a Java program that demonstrates single inheritance by creating a base class `Animal` with a method `makeSound()` and a derived class `Dog` that inherits from `Animal` and has its own method `bark()`.
   - Create a base class `Shape` with a method `draw()`. Derive a subclass `Square` that inherits from `Shape` and has an additional method `calculateArea()`.
2. **Multilevel Inheritance**:
   - Write a program to demonstrate multilevel inheritance where:
     - Class `Vehicle` is the base class.
     - Class `Car` extends `Vehicle`.
     - Class `ElectricCar` extends `Car`.
   - Each class should have its own method (`drive()`, `fuelType()`, `chargeBattery()`) to demonstrate multilevel inheritance.
   - Implement a `University` class with a method `getDetails()`. Create a subclass `Department` that extends `University`, and a subclass `Course` that extends `Department`. Demonstrate how multilevel inheritance works by creating objects and calling methods from different levels.

### **19. Multiple Inheritance**
1. **Explain why multiple inheritance** is not supported in Java with an example. Create two classes `ClassA` and `ClassB` with a method `display()`. Write a program to show the ambiguity that arises if a class `ClassC` tries to inherit from both `ClassA` and `ClassB`.
2. **Demonstrate multiple inheritance** using interfaces. Create two interfaces, `Printable` with a method `print()` and `Showable` with a method `show()`. Implement both interfaces in a class `Demo` and write a program to call both methods.
3. **Write a Java program** that creates an interface `Drivable` with a method `drive()`, and another interface `Flyable` with a method `fly()`. Create a class `FlyingCar` that implements both interfaces and demonstrates multiple inheritance through interfaces.

### **20. Additional Questions**
- **Explain the difference** between single and multiple inheritance with examples.
- **Write a Java program** that uses inheritance to demonstrate the "is-a" relationship. Create a base class `Bank` and a derived class `SavingAccount` to show that `SavingAccount` is a type of `Bank`.
