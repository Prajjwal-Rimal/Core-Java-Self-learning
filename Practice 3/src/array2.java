//2. Explain the need for arrays in Java with an example of managing student grades.

// arrays are needed in java as they can store multiple values of the same type in a memory side by side
// lets say we need to manage the data of students grade what we can do is we an create
// two array students[] and marks[] then we can add value to the array through index calling by loops
// we can also print the array using loops this makes data management easy and all the data will be stored side by
// side in the memory.

// if we were to not create the arrays we would have to use String name and int marks for each number of students
// making the code hard to read and making variable naming difficult also each of the variables would have diffrent
// memory addresses and not a continious one like in array.
