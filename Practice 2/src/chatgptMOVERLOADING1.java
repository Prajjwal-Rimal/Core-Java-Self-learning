//Create a Java class `MathOperations` that includes overloaded methods `add()`:
//- `add(int a, int b)` for adding two integers.
//- `add(double a, double b)` for adding two doubles.
//- `add(int a, int b, int c)` for adding three integers.
//Write a program to demonstrate the usage of these methods.
