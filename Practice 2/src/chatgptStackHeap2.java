//**Question 13:**
//Consider the following Java code:
//```java
//class Example {
//    int x = 10;
//    static int y = 20;
//    public void methodA() {
//        int z = 30;
//    }
//}
//```
//- Identify which variables are stored in stack memory and which are stored in heap memory.
//- Explain what happens to these variables when an object of the class `Example` is
// created and when `methodA()` is called.

class chatgptStackHeap2{
    public static void main(String[]args){}
}

// in the above example int x, static int y is stored in heap
// z is stored in stack
