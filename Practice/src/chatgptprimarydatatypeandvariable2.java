//What is the difference between `float` and `double`?
// Write a code snippet to demonstrate the difference.

class chatgptprimarydatatypeandvariable2{
    public static void main(String[]args){
        float x = 10.9f;// in float it is compulsory to write f
        double d= 10.00;// we dont need to write d in double as by default the value for float is double
        // in java

        System.out.println(x);
        System.out.println(d);
