Here are some Java practice questions covering the topics you mentioned:

### 1. Primary Data Types and Variables
- **Q1:** Declare variables of all primary data types in Java and assign them appropriate values. Print each variable.
- **Q2:** What is the difference between `float` and `double`? Write a code snippet to demonstrate the difference.

### 2. Literals
- **Q3:** Write a Java program that initializes variables using different types of literals (integer, floating-point, character, string, boolean).
- **Q4:** Explain with examples the difference between a string literal and a character literal.

### 3. Type Conversion and Casting
- **Q5:** Write a Java program to demonstrate implicit type conversion.
- **Q6:** Write a Java program to explicitly cast a double to an integer and observe the result.

### 4. Operators
- **Arithmetic Operators**
  - **Q7:** Write a program that takes two numbers as input and performs all arithmetic operations on them.
- **Assignment Operators**
  - **Q8:** Demonstrate the use of all assignment operators in a single Java program.
- **Relational Operators**
  - **Q9:** Write a program that takes two numbers as input and compares them using relational operators.
- **Logical Operators**
  - **Q10:** Create a program that uses logical operators to evaluate multiple conditions and prints the result.

### 5. Scanner Class
- **Q11:** Write a Java program that uses the `Scanner` class to take user input for their name, age, and GPA, then prints this information.
- **Q12:** Create a program that takes an integer input from the user and checks if itâ€™s even or odd.

### 6. Conditional Statements
- **Q13:** Write a Java program that takes a score as input and prints the grade according to the following criteria:
  - `A` for scores >= 90
  - `B` for scores >= 80 and < 90
  - `C` for scores >= 70 and < 80
  - `D` for scores >= 60 and < 70
  - `F` for scores < 60
- **Q14:** Write a program that takes a year as input and checks if itâ€™s a leap year using conditional statements.

### 7. Ternary Operators
- **Q15:** Write a program that takes two integers as input and prints the greater of the two using the ternary operator.
- **Q16:** Use a ternary operator to check if a number is positive, negative, or zero.

### 8. Loops
- **Q17:** Write a program that prints the first 10 natural numbers using a `for` loop.
- **Q18:** Create a program that calculates the factorial of a number using a `while` loop.
- **Q19:** Write a program that prints the multiplication table of a given number using a `do-while` loop.

### 9. Classes and Objects
- **Q20:** Create a class `Car` with properties like `make`, `model`, `year`, and a method `displayDetails()`. Instantiate the class and call the method to display the car's details.
- **Q21:** Write a class `Student` with attributes `name`, `rollNumber`, and `marks`. Create methods to assign values to these attributes and display them.

These questions should give you a solid practice across the various Java topics you're learning.
