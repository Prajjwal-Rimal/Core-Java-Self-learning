/*Write a Java program that prints a table with a list of at least 5 students together with their grades earned (lab
points, bonus points, and the total) in the format below.

///////////////////\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
        ==          Student Points          ==
        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\///////////////////


Name            Lab     Bonus   Total
----            ---     -----   -----
Joe             43      7       50
William         50      8       58
Mary Sue        39      10      49

The rrequirements for the program are as follows:

1.Print the border on the top as illustrated (using the slash and backslash characters).
2.Use tab characters to get your columns aligned and you must use the + operator both
for addition and string concatenation.
3.Make up your own student names and pointsâ€”the ones shown are just for illustration purposes.
You need 5 names.
